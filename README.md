# marketplace
Kodi Marketplace, a new experience to install addons (based on containers).

Since January 1, 2022, addons are called containers, where you will have a better experience than addons, that is, those that are compatible with Linux, an addon will appear with the tag "[ADDON_NAME] _linux", and whatever are compatible with Windows, an addon with the tag "[ADDON_NAME] _windows" will appear.

The addons will be published in a single Docker image: kodi-community/marketplace (in Docker Hub)

Hopefully this new experience works better than addons.
